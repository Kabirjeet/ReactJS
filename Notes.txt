Use PascalCase for components names: 'MyComponent' not 'myComponent'.

-------------------------------------------------Props in React (Properties)----------------------------------------------------------

Allows you to pass data from parent component to child component

❌Disadvantage of Props
Props drilling: If you want to pass component from parent to grandchild element it is props drilling.


✅Why React introduced hooks
✅UseState
✅UseEffect


🚀What are React Hooks?

Hooks are special JavaScript functions introduced in React 1 to 8 that allow functional components to use features like state, lifecycle methods, and more-features that were earlier available only in class components.


✅Why Hooks?

🧽Cleaner, simpler code using funcitons instead of classes
🔄Easier reuse of logic through custom hooks
🧠No need to deal with complex 'this' keyword
🛠️Better code seperation and organization


🧠 The problem before Hooks

____________________________________________________
| Hooks      | Purpose                             |
|--------------------------------------------------|
|useState    | State management                    | 
|useEffect   | Side effects / lifecycle methods    | 
|useRef      | Accessing and persisteing DOM values|
----------------------------------------------------


State is an object that holds data or information about a component that can change over time and influences what the UI looks like.



SYNTAX::

import {useState} from "react";

useState() -> Hooks

const[State, setState] = useState()
